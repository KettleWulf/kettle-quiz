# 🎓 Student Quiz Game

An interactive image-based quiz where the player guesses which student is shown. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS – no frameworks needed. This project has been a fun experiment in core JavaScript techniques and game logic.

## 🧠 What I Practiced in This Project

### ✅ Higher-order array functions
Used built-in JavaScript array methods to write cleaner, more declarative code:
- `map()` – to dynamically render answer buttons
- `filter()` and `find()` – to control which students are shown and avoid duplicates
- `forEach()` – for button behavior and event handling

### 🕹️ Game State Management
The game is powered by a central `state` object, keeping track of:
- Remaining and already guessed students
- The correct answer for the current round
- Player score and round number
- Game length (8, 16, or full mode)

### 🧬 Object Cloning
Used `structuredClone()` to deep copy the initial state and reset the game cleanly between rounds.

### 💬 Player Feedback
- Clear visual feedback (green/red buttons)
- Real-time score updates
- End-of-game screen with personalized message and high score tracking

## 🚧 Potential Improvements

Ideas for future development:

- ♿ **Accessibility**: Add keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- 🎞️ **Animations**: Smooth transitions when showing new images
- ⏱️ **UX Enhancements**: Countdown mode, timer challenges
- 🔊 **Sound effects**: Audio feedback for right/wrong answers
- 💾 **Persistent high score**: Save using `localStorage`

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This project was a hands-on way to explore key JavaScript concepts while building something fun and visually engaging. I'm happy with the result and excited to keep iterating on it!
